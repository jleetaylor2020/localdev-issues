Unable to push code successfully at all with localdev gui - Either by checking 1 box such as database or by checking all 3 boxes to push code in GIT mode - all unsuccessful attempts after multiple tries.
I receive the following crash report with an unsuccessful PUSH of code, files, database. I do not use Lando on my local machine.
